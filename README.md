# degree-of-profanity

Description
This project focuses on detecting and measuring profanity in tweets using Python. It implements a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline to clean and analyze tweets, ultimately calculating the Degree of Profanityâ€”a ratio of offensive words to the total meaningful words in a sentence.


Preprocessing:

Convert text to lowercase for uniformity.
Tokenize sentences into words.
Apply stemming to reduce words to their base forms.
Remove stopwords and punctuation to focus on relevant content.

Profanity Detection-

Compare cleaned words with a predefined list of profane terms.
Calculate profanity as a fraction of detected offensive words relative to the total significant words.

Technologies Used-
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NLTK, Snowball Stemmer

This project demonstrates how effective text preprocessing and analysis can help assess profanity in social media data, paving the way for developing content moderation tools.
